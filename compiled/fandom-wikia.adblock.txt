! Title: Fandom/Wikia specific network and cosmetic filters
! Description: Fandom/Wikia only
!              Network filters will, of course, disable some providers everywhere,
!              but extra care were taken to make those to be precise only to
!              beacons/syncs/tracking/counters/ad-dispensing/opt-in/cookie warning URLs
!              so no other features of site is disabled
!              (like, for example, site's own internal announcements and promotions)
!              as it could happen with more generic lists.
!              Cosmetic filters are repeated in three flavors: hiding filter, removal filter, and HTML filter.
